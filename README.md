Hello myself  **ESHNA JAIN,** 
I want to join **TheWhiteHats** because I am eager to learn Ethical Hacking and strengthen my skills in cybersecurity. 
Cybersecurity News/Incident which i read recently:  In January 2025, Tata Technologies faced a ransomware attack that affected some of its IT systems. The attackers claimed to have stolen 1.4 TB of data. Although Tata restored services and said client delivery was not impacted, the incident highlighted how even large companies in India are vulnerable to ransomware and why strong defenses are critical.
